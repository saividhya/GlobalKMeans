kmeans_fast_main.m        -   Caller method to execute fast global k-means with k-d tree for different bucket numbers
kmeans_normal_main.m      -   Caller method to execute normal k-means algorithm 100 times
mixtureGaussian.m         -   Generates artificial data set and loads MNIST data set and calls the kmeansMain program

Execution instructions
-----------------------

1. Run mixtureGaussian to execute the program for k=3 to 15 for all 3 data sets  for all the 3 data sets
2. Run kmeans_fast_main.m to execute the fast-global with different bucket values for the same data set which is stored in data folder in previous step
3. Run kmeans_normal_main to execute normal k-means 100 times for the same data set

The following MNIST data set is taken from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

t10k-images-idx3-ubyte
t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte
train-images-idx3-ubyte
train-labels-idx1-ubyte

Test script execution - testscript/ folder
-------------------------------------

We have stored all intermediate values in data folder
Run testscript/plot_graph.m to view the graphs
